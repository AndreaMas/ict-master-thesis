# From drawings -> to Radiance Fields -> to 3D meshes

How cool would it be to turn artist-drawn 2D character turnarounds into a 3D representation without no knowledge of 3D sculpting? Or at least to have a good starting ground on which 3D digital artists could build upon? This was the objective of my Master's thesis.


As a solution, I chose to use novel View-Synthesis SoA techniques (Neural Radiance Fields and Plenoxels) to attempt turning character turnarounds into 3D models! Results, although not acceptable for the task by any means (as you can see above), are quite interesting!


This repo holds a PDF of my master's thesis.
